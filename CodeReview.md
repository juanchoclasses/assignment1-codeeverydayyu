The comments are generally readable and provide helpful explanations for the methods and their purposes. More comments explaining the purpose of variables, logic, or any unusual or tricky code are welcome.
- Are the function names self-explanatory?

Most function names are self-explanatory and follow good naming conventions.
The method names like expression, term, and factor clearly indicate their roles in the parsing process.
